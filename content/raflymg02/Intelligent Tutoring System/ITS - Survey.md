# Abstract

ITSs are computer programs that use artificial intelligence techniques to enhance and personalize automation in teaching. The paper is a literature review covering the history and effectiveness of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), discussing the interface between human learning and computer tutors, traditional architectural components, various approaches used by ITSs, and presenting recent innovative ideas, concluding with the author's perspectives on future work in the field.

# Introduction

Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are computer programs that use AI techniques to provide intelligent tutors that know what they teach, whom they teach, and how to teach. AI helps simulate human tutors in order to produce intelligent tutors. ITSs motivate students to perform challenging reasoning tasks by capitalizing on multimedia capabilities to present information. For historical reasons, much of the research in the domain of educational software involving AI has been conducted under the name of Intelligent Computer-Aided Instruction (ICAI).

# Human vs Computer

A one-on-one tutor allows the student to work around difficulties by guiding them to a strategy that works and helping them understand what does not. In addition, tutors usually promote a sense of challenge, provoke curiosity, and maintain a student’s feeling of being in control. Human tutors give hints and suggestions to students rather than giving them explicit solutions. This motivates students to overcome challenges. Furthermore, human tutors are highly interactive in that they give constant feedback to students while the students are solving problems. In order to enable an ITS to give similar feedback as given by a human tutor, we must ensure that it interacts with students as human tutors do. This leads to the question of how to make an ITS deal with students as effectively as human tutors.

When modeling ITSs, a student’s problem solving processes must be monitored step by step. By keeping track of the steps incrementally, it is possible to detect if a student has made a mistake so that the system can intervene to help the student recover. Feedback can be provided when mistakes are made and hints can be given if students are unsure of how to proceed.



# Architecture

The traditional ‘typical’ ITS has four basic components: the domain model which stores domain knowledge, the student model which stores the current state of an individual student in order to choose a suitable new problem for the student, and the tutor model which stores pedagogical knowledge and makes decisions about when and how to intervene.

According to VanLehn, ITSs behave in similar ways such that they involve two loops named inner loop and outer loop. The outer loop mainly decides which task students should practice next among other tasks. The decision takes place based on the student’s history of knowledge and background. The inner loop is responsible for monitoring the student’s solution steps within a task by providing appropriate pedagogical intervention such as feedback on a step, hints on the next step, assessment of knowledge and review of the solution.

# Conclusion
The gap between human tutors and software tutors in the form of ITSs is narrowing, but not closed, even remotely. Many different models exist for representing knowledge, teaching styles and student knowledge. Each model has its benefits and shortcomings.
