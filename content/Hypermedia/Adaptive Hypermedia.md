# Introduction

Adaptive hypermedia is an alternative to the traditional “one-size-fits-all” approach in the development of hypermedia systems. Adaptive hypermedia systems build a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each individual user, and use this model throughout the interaction with the user, in order to adapt to the needs of that user.

# History

## Before 1996

Adaptive Hypermedia research can be traced back to the early 1990s. At that time, the two main parent areas - Hypertext and User Modeling - had achieved a level of maturity that allowed for the cross-fertilization of research ideas. The first research efforts were independent and the early researchers were generally not aware about each other's work. The support from the already established user modeling research community was influential in helping the existing research teams to find each other, and in recognizing and promoting adaptive hypermedia as an independent research direction in user modeling.

By that time, several innovative adaptive hypermedia techniques had been developed, and several research-level adaptive hypermedia systems had been built and evaluated. For more information, the reader is referred to the review of adaptive hypermedia systems, methods and techniques at that time (Brusilovsky, 1996).

## After 1996

The year of 1996 can be considered a turning point in adaptive hypermedia research. Before this time, research in this area was performed by a few isolated teams. However, since 1996, adaptive hypermedia has gone through a period of rapid growth. In particular, several new research teams have commenced projects in adaptive hypermedia, and many students have selected adaptive hypermedia as the subject area for their PhD theses.

# Systems, Methods, Techniques
## Where to use?

The review identified six kinds of adaptive hypermedia systems in 1996 – educational hypermedia, on-line information systems, on-line help systems, information retrieval hypermedia, institutional hypermedia, and systems for managing personalized views in information spaces.

Educational hypermedia and on-line information systems are now established leaders. Together, they account for about two thirds of the research efforts in adaptive hypermedia. Information retrieval (IR) hypermedia is challenging the leaders. The traditional scope of IR hypermedia was extended and now includes also systems for managing personalized views.

## Adapting to What?

# Future Trends
## Direction of Expansion
- Integration with other apps
- Open corpus adaptive hypermedia
- Handheld and mobile devices
## New Technologies
- Natural language generation
- Non-symbolic AI
	A solid amount of research in modern AI is connected with various “non-symbolic” approaches such as case-based reasoning, machine learning, Bayesian models, and neural networks.
